        My role at Fox & Farthing was to lay the groundwork for upcoming projects.  This included initial client meetings, project scope and roadmapping, 
        managing a small team of developers, and building out the initial prototypes for the projects.  I released one major project and assisted on a variety 
        of smaller projects during my time here.
