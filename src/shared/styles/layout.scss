// Do I want the layout styles to be localized to this file?

// Currently, we are building a nonrelational grid system
// for displaying sketches in `SketchesHome`.  Would it be
// a better alternative to move this grid system into 
// this file and then import it where needed?

// Components that will likely use a nonrelational grid: 
// - SketchesHome
// - ArtHome
// - ProjectsHome
// - BlogHome??
